## ***WELCOME TO MY PERSONAL BLOG***

The reason why I wanted to join **AMRITA CS-STAR** is that i wish to learn more about computing and enjoy the latest CS techniques.

I am intersted in the field of Web content management, Wireless sensor networks and Data analytics.

If i'm selected, i would like to work on Wireless Sensor Networks. The reason is that i would like to learn how the sesors work and how to manipulate it.
